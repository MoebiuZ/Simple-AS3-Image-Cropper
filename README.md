Simple-AS3-Image-Cropper
========================

An image cropper to upload fixed size images.

I made this editor for a project where I need to upload pictures to several records on a remote database. The images needed to share a fixed size, so this allow the uploader to resize and reposition an image to crop it on his preferred "view", instead cropping only its center.


This code will need some tweaking if you want to use it for your projects, including canvas size, urls, input data and saving paths on server.
